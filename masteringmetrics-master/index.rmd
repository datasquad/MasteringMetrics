# Welcome {-}

This work contains R code to reproduce many of the analyses in *Mastering 'Metrics* by Joshua D. Angrist and JÃ¶rn-Steffen Pischke [@AngristPischke2014].
This work provides R translations of the replication code available at [masteringmetrics.com](http://masteringmetrics.com/resources/).

The R code used in the examples heavily depends on [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages.
I suggest starting with Grolemund and Wickham, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) if you are unfamiliar with the tidyverse.

## Install {-}

To install all R packages and datasets needed to run the examples in *Mastering 'Metrics* run:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrnold/masteringmetrics", subdir = "masteringmetrics")
```
